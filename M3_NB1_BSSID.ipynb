    "In this notebook, you will examine the WiFi scan data set that you loaded in an exercise in Module 1's Notebook 2. You will also use the public data set from Dartmouth College, [(StudentLife)](http://studentlife.cs.dartmouth.edu/dataset.html) that was introduced in Module 1.\n",

    "Before continuing with this notebook, it is important to understand the definition of a [BSSID](http://www.juniper.net/techpubs/en_US/network-director1.1/topics/concept/wireless-ssid-bssid-essid.html). A BSSID (Basic Service Set Identifier) is the  media access control (MAC) address (or physical address) of a wireless access point (WAP). It is generated by combining the 24-bit organizationally unique identifier (OUI) (the manufacturer's identity), and the manufacturer's assigned 24-bit identifier for the radio chipset in the WAP. In short, every router has a unique address, which will be utilized in this notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "Typically, in any analysis, you will start with an idea that you need to validate. In the video content of this module, Arek Stopczynski suggests that you test ideas on yourself first, as this is the easiest way to validate your assumptions about the data generated. As a result, you will be able to quickly spot anomalies based on your understanding of your own behavior and patterns. Once you have a functional data set and hypothesis, you should also start to consider cases where the behaviors of others do not necessarily align to your own.\n",
    "\n",
    "In many cases the data is reviewed manually. When performing an analysis, you need to validate all of your assumptions, and be able to logically describe what you want to do, before selecting a method of execution. In some cases, the functions you utilize may behave in unexpected ways. Therefore, you need to constantly perform checks to ensure that the output values are correct and as expected. Pandas is a tried-and-tested library with a large following of loyal users. However, this does not necessarily extend to other libraries you may come across."

Another instance where the high number of connections could be misleading would be with a mobile hotspot.
